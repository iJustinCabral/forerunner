# Forerunner (Raycaster Prototype)

This project serves as a prototype sandbox for a raycasted FPS in the vein of the classic Wolfenstein 3D. I always wanted to learn from the ground up how a game like this was made and after reading the Game Engine Black Book about it, I figured to give it a legitmate shot. 

Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map. Back when computers were slower it wasn't possible to run real 3D engines in realtime, and raycasting was the first solution. Raycasting can go very fast, because only a calculation has to be done for every vertical line of the screen.The raycasting engine of Wolfenstein 3D was very limited, allowing it to run on a even a 286 computer: all the walls have the same height and are orthogonal squares on a 2D grid.

I will try attempt to make some improvements based on where I feel its needed, but I do want to stay pretty true to the original concept.
